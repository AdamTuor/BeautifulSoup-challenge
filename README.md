# BeautifulSoup-challenge

This project consists of two deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

BeautifulSoup was used to scrape articles and previews as well as a table.  The data was then cleaned and transformed into a pandas dataframe in order to do calculations and visualizations.
